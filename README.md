Stock Prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Stock Prediction

This repository contains an implementation of stock price prediction using LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), for time series forecasting. The model is trained on historical stock price data to predict future stock prices.

Results

The performance of the LSTM model on the test dataset is evaluated, and the predictions are visualized using appropriate plots. The effectiveness of the model is measured by comparing the predicted stock prices with the actual stock prices.
Future Improvements
